# hello-world

hi, my name is Nick. I've been wanting to get into programming for a long time. right now I am finishing my bachelor's degree in applied maths and computer science, which is actually not really contributing to my growth as a programmer.
that's why I decided to get on git and do some self-teaching while working on projects.
what will those be? I do not yet know. I know a little Python and I'm interested in learning JS and getting into web development.

god save us all, especially those whose lives are in danger because of Irma.
